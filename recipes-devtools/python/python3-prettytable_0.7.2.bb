DESCRIPTION = " \
	PrettyTable is a simple Python library designed to make it quick and easy to represent tabular data \
	in visually appealing ASCII tables. It was inspired by the ASCII tables used in the PostgreSQL shell \
	psql. PrettyTable allows for selection of which columns are to be printed, independent alignment of \
	columns (left or right justified or centred) and printing of “sub-tables” by specifying a row range.\
	"
